Free Fatty Acid (FFA) Content: Indicates the level of fatty acids in the oil. High FFA can affect the taste and stability.

Standard: ≤ 5% (for crude palm oil)
Moisture and Impurities: Measures the amount of water and impurities in the oil.

Standard: ≤ 0.1%
Peroxide Value: Indicates the extent of oxidation that has occurred.

Standard: ≤ 10 meq/kg
Iodine Value: Measures the degree of unsaturation in the oil.

Standard: 50-55 g I2/100g
Color: Assessed using a colorimeter, typically expressed in Lovibond units.

Standard: ≤ 3 Red in a 5.25" cell for refined palm oil
Melting Point: Indicates the temperature at which the oil transitions from solid to liquid.

Standard: 33-39°C for crude palm oil
Deterioration of Bleachability Index (DOBI): Measures the ease of refining the oil.

Standard: ≥ 2.5
Fatty Acid Composition: Analysis of the types of fatty acids present (e.g., palmitic, oleic, linoleic acids).

Saponification Value: Indicates the amount of potassium hydroxide required to saponify the oil.

Standard: 190-209 mg KOH/g
Unsaponifiable Matter: Components in the oil that do not form soap.

Standard: ≤ 1.5%
